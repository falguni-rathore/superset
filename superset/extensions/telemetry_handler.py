    Handler for telemetry events.

    To use this, decorate an endpoint with `@show_telemetry`:

        from superset.extensions import telemetry

        @expose("/")
        @show_telemetry
        def some_endpoint() -> str:
            with telemetry.add("Computation"):
                output = {"answer": some_computation()}

            return jsonify(output)

        def some_computation() -> int:
            with telemetry.add("Crunching numbers"):
                return magic()

    The response payload will then look like this:

        {
            # original response
            "answer": 42,

            # added telemetry
            "telemetry": [
                {
                    "name": "Computation",
                    "start": 1710360466.328792,
